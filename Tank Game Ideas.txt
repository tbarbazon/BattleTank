Concept:
Open World Tank Fighter


Rules:
	WS moves tank
	AD has *cooldown*? does side barrel roll flip or might just need to shoot ground somehow??
	mouse moves gun on top
	can go up most slopes (around 65o)
	Point based system
	Cap Flag\point gets more points then kills (5 to 1)
	Tribes ascend like skiing mechanic

Atmosphere:
	Needs to be fun. 
	dont waste to much time/ resources on looks.
	something like tribes ascend for map.
	Tank needs creeks and movement sounds
	Explosions and shooting sounds
	background music
