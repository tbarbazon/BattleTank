Concept:
Open World Tank Fighter


Rules:
	WASD moves tank
	mouse moves gun on top
	can go up most slopes (around 65o)
	Point based system
	Cap Flag\point gets more points then kills (5 to 1)
	*maybe add some cool physics to change normal tank games.

Atmosphere:
	Needs to be fun. 
	dont waste to much time/ resources on looks.
	something like tribes ascend for map.
	Tank needs creeks and movement sounds
	Explosions and shooting sounds
	background music
